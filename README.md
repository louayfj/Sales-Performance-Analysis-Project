# Sales Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance data to uncover key insights and trends. By leveraging data analysis tools like Python, SQL, and Excel, along with machine learning models, we aim to provide actionable insights for improving sales strategies, understanding customer behavior, and identifying growth opportunities.

## Project Objectives
- **Analyze sales performance data:** Explore the dataset to identify key metrics such as total revenue, sales growth, and regional performance.
- **Understand customer behavior:** Segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and analyze customer lifetime value (CLV).
- **Predict future sales:** Build predictive models to forecast future sales trends using machine learning algorithms.
- **Visualize findings:** Use visual storytelling to communicate insights effectively through data visualizations and reports.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
  - Handle missing values, anomalies, and inconsistent entries.
  - Feature engineering to create meaningful attributes for deeper analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Descriptive statistics to understand trends, outliers, and patterns.
  - Correlation analysis between different sales variables.
- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - Machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to forecast future sales.
  - Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- **Visualization & Reporting:**
  - Visualize trends using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Excel charts.
  - Storytelling with data techniques to present findings in a compelling and clear manner.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database:** SQL-based queries for data extraction
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel, Power BI
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn for regression and classification models

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/louayfj/sales-performance-analysis.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

cd sales-performance-analysis

Install dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the analysis:
        Execute the Python notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
        Use main.py to run the full analysis pipeline.

Dataset

The dataset includes information on sales transactions, customer details, and product performance.

    Note: The dataset used is confidential and cannot be shared publicly. You can replace it with your own dataset in the /data directory.

Results

    Detailed insights into sales trends across different regions and customer segments.
    Predictive models that provide a reliable forecast of future sales performance.
    Visualizations that highlight key findings and areas for improvement.

Future Work

    Enhance predictive models: Improve accuracy by experimenting with additional machine learning models such as gradient boosting or neural networks.
    Automation: Automate the data extraction and analysis pipeline to handle new sales data on a regular basis.
    Dashboard Creation: Create an interactive dashboard for real-time sales monitoring using Power BI or Tableau.
