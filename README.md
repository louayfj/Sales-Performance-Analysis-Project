# Sales Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project uses Python to analyze sales performance data. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover key trends and insights related to sales, customer behavior, and overall performance.

## Project Objectives
- **Analyze sales performance data:** Explore the dataset to identify key metrics such as total revenue, sales growth, and regional performance.
- **Understand customer behavior:** Segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and analyze customer lifetime value (CLV).
- **Visualize findings:** Use visual storytelling to communicate insights effectively through data visualizations and reports.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
  - Handle missing values, anomalies, and inconsistent entries.
  - Feature engineering to create meaningful attributes for deeper analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Descriptive statistics to understand trends, outliers, and patterns.
  - Correlation analysis between different sales variables.
- **Visualization & Reporting:**
  - Visualize trends using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Excel charts.
  - Storytelling with data techniques to present findings in a compelling and clear manner.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/louayfj/sales-performance-analysis.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

cd sales-performance-analysis

Install dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the analysis:
        Execute the Python notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
        Use main.py to run the full analysis pipeline.

Dataset

The dataset includes information on sales transactions, customer details, and product performance.

    Note: The dataset used is confidential and cannot be shared publicly. You can replace it with your own dataset in the /data directory.

Results

    Detailed insights into sales trends across different regions and customer segments.
    Predictive models that provide a reliable forecast of future sales performance.
    Visualizations that highlight key findings and areas for improvement.

Future Work

    Enhance predictive models: Improve accuracy by experimenting with additional machine learning models such as gradient boosting or neural networks.
    Automation: Automate the data extraction and analysis pipeline to handle new sales data on a regular basis.
    Dashboard Creation: Create an interactive dashboard for real-time sales monitoring using Power BI or Tableau.
